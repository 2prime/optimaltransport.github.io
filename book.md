This book reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it particularly useful for some of these ap- plications. Our focus is on the recent wave of efficient algorithms that have helped translate attractive theoretical properties onto elegant and scalable tools for a wide variety of applications. We also give a prominent place to the many generalizations of OT that have been proposed in but a few years, and connect them with related approaches originating from statistical inference, kernel methods and information theory.
